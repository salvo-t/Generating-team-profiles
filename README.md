# Generating-team-profiles
module 10 team profiles
My team profile generator is a way you can generator team cards for your company. It uses inquirer and jest but all you have to do is run jest
in the console using "npm test" then run "node index.js". You'll be prompted with a question saying what is your team members name. After that
It'll ask for the id, the email and finally the role of the employee "Engineer", "Intern" or "Manager". Each of these roles, have a
additional unique choice to choose. For engineer it will ask for a github, intern it will ask for their college, and manager for the office
number.

After each memeber is added youll be asked if youre finished or you can add another team member. After youre done chosing all the team memebers
the generated page should look somthing like this.
